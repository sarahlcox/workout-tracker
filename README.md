### Description
This is a website application that allows a user to create, and track their daily workouts. It allows the user create new workouts, and add additional exercises to their current workout. Upon completion of the workout, it allows the user to view the stats of their last workout. On the "dashboard" (https://gentle-taiga-95665.herokuapp.com/stats) it allows the user to view the combined weight of their exercises, and the total duration.
